During the 2nd year of my Bachelors degree in Games Programming, I was tasked to make a 3D scene using the OpenGL API.
Through this post, I'll detail step by step the inner workings of my scene and the different techniques, functionalities and concepts I've learned throughout all of it.

**Overview**

To start off, it would be a good idea to have a proper plan of the general workings of my scene before heading into the details.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

**Conclusion**

Creating this scene has opened my eyes to a whole other spectrum of programming which I knew pratically nothing about.

It was simultaneously a really interesting and deeply frustrating experience which challenged a lot of my notions in debugging and architercural design. Would have this been infinitely easier if I didn't attempt to make a barebone engine instead of just a hard-coded scene ? Yes, definitely, it ended up costing me many long hours of work trying to sort out this system I had set up. However, it also taught me a lot about 

Would I be interested in looking further in computer graphics after this ? Undoubtedly, even if I'm not sure to understand everything yet, it is fascinating work that I'll try bettering myself in the future.
